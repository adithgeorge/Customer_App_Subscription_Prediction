# Customer_App_Subscription_Prediction

## Introduction

In today's market, many companies have a mobile presence. Often, these companies provide free products/services in their mobile apps in an attempt to transition their customers to a paid membership. For this, you need a Budget. Since marketing efforts are never free, these companies need to know exactly who to target with offers and promotions.

* Market: The target audience is customers who use a company's free product. In this case study, this refers to users who installed (and used) the company's free mobile app.

* Product: The paid memberships often provide enhanced versions of the free products already given for free, alongside new features.

* Goal: The objective of this model is to predict which users will and will not subscribe to the premium membership so that we can focus our marketing efforts to convert these users to paid users. The marketing strategy can be bothways, We can either focus our limited resources on those who are more willing to take a subscription thereby increasing our profit with less effort or we could focus on converting those who are less willing to take a subscription.
